libsixel
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saitoha/libsixel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saitoha/libsixel)

## What is this?

This package provides encoder/decoder implementation for DEC SIXEL graphics, and
some converter programs.

![img2sixel](http://zuse.jp/misc/libsixel-1.png)

SIXEL is one of image formats for printer and terminal imaging introduced by
Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC).
Its data scheme is represented as a terminal-friendly escape sequence.
So if you want to view a SIXEL image file, all you have to do is "cat" it to your terminal.

## Build and install

```
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
```

## Configure options

### Build with optional packages

```
--with-gdk-pixbuf2      build with gdk-pixbuf2 (default: no)
--with-libcurl          build with libcurl (default: no)
--with-gd               build with gd (default: no)
```


## Terminal requirements

If you want to view a SIXEL image, you have to get a terminal which support sixel graphics.

Now SIXEL feature is supported by the following terminals.

- VT240

- VT241

- VT330

- VT340

- VT382

- RLogin (Japanese terminal emulator)

  [http://nanno.dip.jp/softlib/man/rlogin/](http://nanno.dip.jp/softlib/man/rlogin/)

- tanasinn (Works with firefox)

  [http://zuse.jp/tanasinn/](http://zuse.jp/tanasinn/)

- mlterm

  [http://mlterm.sourceforge.net/](http://mlterm.sourceforge.net/)

  Works on each of X, win32/cygwin, framebuffer version.

- XTerm (compiled with --enable-sixel option)

  [http://invisible-island.net/xterm/](http://invisible-island.net/xterm/)

  You should launch xterm with "-ti 340" option. the SIXEL palette is limited to a maximum of 16 colors.

- DECterm

- Kermit

- WRQ Reflection

- ZSTEM
