.SH NAME
img2sixel \- image converter to DEC SIXEL graphics


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B img2sixel
[ \-\fIoptions\fP ] \fIimagefiles\fP
.br
.B img2sixel
[ \-\fIoptions\fP ] < \fIimagefiles\fP
.ta .5i 1.8i


.SH DESCRIPTION
.I img2sixel
convert JPEG/PNG images into DEC SIXEL image format.


.SH "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS"
\fIimg2sixel\fP has the following command-line options:
.TP 5
.B \-7, \-\-7bit-mode
generate a sixel image for 7bit terminals or printers (default).
.TP 5
.B \-8, \-\-8bit-mode
generate a sixel image for 8bit terminals or printers.
.TP 5
.B \-p \fICOLORS\fP, \-\-colors=\fICOLORS\fP
specify number of colors to reduce the image to (default=256).
.TP 5
.B \-m \fIFILE\fP, \-\-mapfile=\fIFILE\fP
transform image colors to match this set of colorsspecify map.
.TP 5
.B \-e, \-\-monochrome
output monochrome(1bpp) sixel image.
.TP 5
.B \-d \fIDIFFUSIONTYPE\fP, \-\-diffusion=\fIDIFFUSIONTYPE\fP
choose diffusion method which used with color reduction.
.br
\fIDIFFUSIONTYPE\fP is one of them:
.br
auto     -> choose diffusion type automatically (default)
.br
none     -> do not diffusion
.br
fs       -> Bill Atkinson's method
.br
atkinson -> Floyd-Steinberg method
.br
jajuni   -> Jarvis, Judice & Ninke
.br
stucki   -> Stucki's method
.br
burkes   -> Burkes' method
.TP 5
.B \-f \fIFINDTYPE\fP, \-\-find\-largest=\fIFINDTYPE\fP
choose method for finding the largest dimention of median
cut boxes for splitting, make sence only when -p option
(color reduction) is specified.
.br
\fIFINDTYPE\fP is one of them:
.br
auto -> choose finding method automatically (default)
.br
norm -> simply comparing the range in RGB space
.br
lum  -> transforming into luminosities before the comparison
.TP 5
.B \-s \fISELECTTYPE\fP, \-\-select\-color=\fISELECTTYPE\fP
choose the method for selecting representative color from each
median-cut box, make sence only when -p option (color reduction) is
specified.
.br
\fISELECTTYPE\fP is one of them:
.br
auto     -> choose selecting method automatically (default)
.br
center   -> choose the center of the box
.br
average  -> caclulate the color average into the box
.br
histgram -> similar with average but considers color histgram
.TP 5
.B \-w \fIWIDTH\fP, \-\-width=\fIWIDTH\fP
resize image to specific width.
.br
\fIWIDTH\fP is represented by the following syntax:
.br
auto       -> preserving aspect ratio (default)
.br
<number>%  -> scale width with given percentage
.br
<number>   -> scale width with pixel counts
.br
<number>px -> scale width with pixel counts
.TP 5
.B \-h \fIHEIGHT\fP, \-\-height=\fIHEIGHT\fP
resize image to specific height.
.br
\fIHEIGHT\fP is represented by the following syntax
.br
auto       -> preserving aspect ratio (default)
.br
<number>%  -> scale height with given percentage
.br
<number>   -> scale height with pixel counts
.br
<number>px -> scale height with pixel counts
.TP 5
.B \-r \fIRESAMPLINGTYPE\fP, \-\-resampling=\fIRESAMPLINGTYPE\fP
choose resampling method used with -w or -h option (scaling).
.br
\fIRESAMPLINGTYPE\fP is one of them:
.br
nearest  -> Nearest-Neighbor method
.br
gaussian -> Gaussian filter
.br
hanning  -> Hanning filter
.br
hamming  -> Hamming filter
.br
bilinear -> Bilinear filter (default)
.br
welsh    -> Welsh filter
.br
bicubic  -> Bicubic filter
.br
lanczos2 -> Lanczos-2 filter
.br
lanczos3 -> Lanczos-3 filter
.br
lanczos4 -> Lanczos-4 filter
.TP 5
.B \-q \fIQUALITYMODE\fP, \-\-quality=\fIQUALITYMODE\fP
select quality of color quanlization.
.br
\fIQUALITYMODE\fP is one of them:
.br
auto -> decide quality mode automatically (default)
.br
high -> high quality and low speed mode
.br
low  -> low quality and high speed mode

.SH AUTHORS
\fIimg2sixel\fP is maintained by Hayaki Saito.
We imported whole code of \fIstbi-1.33\fP, written by Sean Barrett and its contributers, for loading PNG/JPEG images,
and imported some code from \fIpnmquant.c (netpbm library)\fP for image quantization.
